Working condition tested on Linux, Windows and macOS, Python 3.9+

This software is designed for trading on the [Bitmex.com](https://www.bitmex.com), [Bybit.com](https://www.bybit.com) and [Deribit.com](https://www.deribit.com) marketplaces.

API information:

| Exchange|API Overview|API Explorer|API Connector|
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|Bitmex|[bitmex.com/app/apiOverview](https://www.bitmex.com/app/apiOverview)|[bitmex.com/api/explorer/](https://testnet.bitmex.com/api/explorer/)|[github.com/BitMEX/api-connectors](https://github.com/BitMEX/api-connectors)|
|Bybit|[bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/v5/intro](https://bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/v5/intro)|[bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/api-explorer/v5/category](https://bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/api-explorer/v5/category)|[github.com/bybit-exchange/pybit](https://github.com/bybit-exchange/pybit)|
|Deribit|[docs.deribit.com](https://docs.deribit.com)|[www.deribit.com/api_console](https://www.deribit.com/api_console)|-|

The software allows you to monitor trading balances and make transactions manually and automatically for Bitmex, Bybit and Deribit exchanges simultaneously.

## Software Features

- Automatic placement of trade orders and tracking their execution.

- Monitoring of funding and open positions.

- Accounting in the database of all transactions, calculation of results and funding.

- Simultaneous use of any number of trading strategies for different trading instruments with separation of financial results in the database.

- Bot management feature that allows you to create, delete, merge bots and track their activity.

## Who is this software for

If you are a trader who is thinking about automating your strategies, this software can save you months of effort in creating an application that can interact with exchanges.

## Before launch

Although the software can be used for manual trading, it is mainly intended to be used for automated one, opposite to the standard exchange trading web-interface.

You can use your local computer to run the software, but for stable 24/7 operation, it is highly recommended to use a remote server. For these purposes, it is enough to subscribe to any VPS (Virtual Private Server) with 4GB of memory and several gigabytes of free disk space after installing the operating system and the required packages. To monitor the server, you can utilize the standard capabilities provided by the VPS provider or use, for example, ssh+vncviewer tools.

Python is a cross-platform programming language, so it is suitable for Windows, Linux and macOS. It is more convenient for the server to use Linux with any current distribution at the moment, e.g. Debian 11.

Before running the program on a real account, it is strongly recommended to debug it on the testnet:

- [testnet.bitmex.com](https://testnet.bitmex.com)
- [testnet.bybit.com](https://testnet.bybit.com)
- [test.deribit.com/](https://test.deribit.com)

A local computer is sufficient to debug the software.

## Installation on local computer

1. Create a new folder and download the program there. *This is not required, but it is recommended to install and activate the venv virtual environment to avoid installing Python packages globally. For example for Linux: 1) python3 -m venv venv 2) source venv/bin/activate*
2. Install the packages:

```
pip3 install pycryptodome
pip3 install python-dotenv
pip3 install websocket-client
pip3 install requests
pip3 install pygments
```

*or use the command:*

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
3. The program uses an SQLite database and can work without installing a database management system. After running Tmatic for the first time, the tmatic.db file will be generated automatically. The database consists of the tables:

- ```real_trade``` - stores all previously executed transactions and accrued funding.
- ```test_trade``` - stores all previously executed transactions and accrued funding in the test network.
- ```robots``` - parameters of trading bots.
- ```expired``` - parameters of expired instruments that were previously traded. When restoring the trading history and an expired instrument is found, Tmatic first checks the instrument parameters in the `expired` table. If the instrument is not found, it gets the information from the exchange endpoint and stores it in the `expired` table to speed up the loading process in the future.

The columns of the `real_trade` and `test_trade` tables are identical.

The `real_trade` (`test_trade`) table receives data from the websocket execution stream or trade history endpoint. Explanations for the columns:
* ID - row number in the database.
* EXECID - unique code that exchange assigns to any transaction.
* EMI is the identification name of the bot taken from the "clOrdID" field. EMI usually corresponds to the EMI field of the SQLite "robots" table.

| execution|myBot is in the "robots" table|EMI|
| ------------- |:------------------:|:-----:|
| {"clOrdID": "1109594183.myBot", "symbol": "XBTUSD"}|yes|myBot|
| {"clOrdID": "", "symbol": "XBTUSD"}|-|XBTUSD|
| {"clOrdID": "1109594183.myBot", "symbol": "XBTUSD"}|no|XBTUSD|

* REFER - the EMI part of the "clOrdID" field. E.g. REFER = "myBot" for ```{"clOrdID": "1109594183.myBot"}```. If the exchange closes an open position after the instrument expires, in this case the REFER field takes the value "".
* MARKET - name of the exchange.
* CURRENCY - currency of a transaction or funding.
* TICKER - instrument symbol as presented in the exchange API.
* SYMBOL - almost the same as TICKER, with exception of the spot category, where SYMBOL looks like "instrument baseCoin / instrument quoteCoin", example "BTC/USDT".
* CATEGORY - instrument category. Possible values ​​depend on the specific exchange. Example: "linear", "inverse", "quanto", "spot", "option", etc.
* SIDE - side of a transaction: "Buy", "Sell", "Fund" (funding).
* QTY - transaction volume.
* QTY_REST - rest of transaction volume after partial execution.
* PRICE - order price.
* THEOR_PRICE - target price.
* TRADE_PRICE - transaction price or estimated funding price. The transaction price may be better or worse than PRICE.
* SUMREAL - execution value, which is expressed in the currency of the transaction instrument and is calculated in accordance with the documentation of the exchange for each instrument.
* COMMISS - funding amount or commission for completing a transaction, expressed in the currency of the instrument, and is calculated in accordance with the documentation of the exchange for each instrument. A negative value means a rebate.
* TTIME - transaction time received from the exchange.
* DAT - time the current row was written into the database.
* CLORDID - unique order identifier assigned by Tmatic corresponding to the "clOrdID" field, which the exchange registers as an additional parameter when sending an order. For example, clOrdID = "1109594183.myBot" where 1109594183 is a unique order number assigned by Tmatic, "myBot" after the dot is the bot name (EMI). When writing "clOrdID" to the SQLite `real_trade` (`test_trade`) table it is split and in this case "myBot" is written to the EMI column and 1109594183 is written to the CLORDID column. An order can be executed in parts, and by receiving information from the exchange using "clOrdID" you can understand which order is being executed and which bot placed it. The "clOrdID" field can be 0. This means that it was funding or the order was made from outside this platform where "clOrdID" was not used. If the exchange closes an open position after the instrument expires, in this case the REFER field takes the value "Delivery".
* MARKET - name of the exchange.
* ACCOUNT - user's exchange account number.

Explanations for the columns of the SQLite `robots` table:
* EMI - bot identity name.
* SORT - allows you to do your own sorting when reading from the database.
* DAT - time the current row was written to the database.
* TIMEFR - timeframe that the bot uses. Possible values at the moment: "tick", "1min", "2min", "3min", "5min", "10min", "15min", "20min", "30min", "1h", "2h", "3h", "4h", "6h", "12h", "1D".
* STATE - Possible values: "Disconnected", "Suspended" or "Active".
* UPDATED - update time for bot parameters or strategy.py file.

Columns of the `expired` table:
* ID - row number in the database.
* SYMBOL - almost the same as TICKER, with exception of the spot category, where SYMBOL looks like "instrument baseCoin / instrument quoteCoin", example "BTC/USDT".
* MARKET - name of the exchange.
* CURRENCY - currency of a transaction or funding.
* TICKER - instrument symbol as presented in the exchange API.
* CATEGORY - instrument category. Possible values ​​depend on the specific exchange.
* MYMULTIPLIER - *for Bitmex only*. Converts quantity when displayed on screen. For other exchanges it is equal to 1.
* MULTIPLIER - *for Bitmex only*. How much is one contract worth. You can see this information under the Bitmex Contract Specifications for each instrument. For other exchanges it is equal to 1.
* TICKSIZE - the step to increase/reduce order price.
* PRICE_PRECISION - based on the `tickSize` of the instrument. Used to round prices ​when displayed on the screen.
* MINORDERQTY - minimum order quantity or lotsize.
* QTYSTEP - the step to increase/reduce order quantity. Also called LotSize.
* PRECISION - based on the ``lotSize`` of the instrument. Used to round volumes ​​when displayed on the screen.
* EXPIRE - expiration time.
* BASECOIN - base coin.
* QUOTECOIN - quote coin.
* VALUEOFONECONTRACT - *for Bitmex only*. Used when calculating trade value. For other exchanges it is equal to 1.
* TAKERFEE - taker's commission for instrument.
* MAKERFEE - maker's commission for instrument.
* DAT - time the current row was written into the database.

## Launch the program

It is recommended to debug the program on the test network first.

Once you have downloaded the program and installed the necessary packages listed above, you can simply run Tmatic using the terminal in the folder where you downloaded the program:

Launch the program:
- in Linux or macOS terminal ```python3 main.py```
- in Windows command prompt (cmd.exe) ```python main.py```

If you don’t have API credentials set up, you’ll be redirected to the settings page.

![Image](https://github.com/evgrmn/tmatic/blob/main/scr/settings_menu.png)

Follow the Tmatic setup instructions and add your API keys and secret. If you don’t have them, here are a few places you can get them for the testnet environment:

|exchange|url|
| ------------- | ------------------ |
|Bitmex|[testnet.bitmex.com/app/apiKeys](https://testnet.bitmex.com/app/apiKeys)|
|Bybit|[testnet.bybit.com/app/user/api-management](https://testnet.bybit.com/app/user/api-management)|
|Deribit|[test.deribit.com/account/BTC/API](https://test.deribit.com/account/BTC/API)|

The settings are stored in two files: ```.env.Settings``` and ```.env.Subscriptions```. By default, they look like like this:

```.env.Settings```

```Python
MARKET_LIST='Bitmex,Bybit,Deribit'
SQLITE_DATABASE='tmatic.db'

```

- MARKET_LIST currently supports Bitmex, Bybit, and Deribit, sorted by how they appear in the app.

- SQLITE_DATABASE — the name of the database.

- ORDER_BOOK_DEPTH is a choice between "orderBook" which allows you to see the order book two to ten lines deep, and "quote" which shows only the best buy and sell while significantly reducing network traffic.

- BOTTOM_FRAME — selects your preferred table from Orders, Positions, Trades, Funding, Account, Results and Robots, which will always be visible at the bottom of the main page.

- REFRESH_RATE — determines how often the information on the screen is refreshed, from 1 to 10 times per second.

- TESTNET — "YES" activates the test network.

- CONNECTED — "YES" means that the exchange must be connected.

- HTTP_URL — the exchange's http network.

- WS_URL — the exchange's web socket network.

- API_KEY — the API key received from the exchange.

- API_SECRET — the secret code received from the exchange.

The next four parameters have the same meanings, but are related to the test network.

```.env.Subscriptions```

```Python
Bitmex_SYMBOLS='XBTUSDT'
Bybit_SYMBOLS='BTCUSDT'
Deribit_SYMBOLS='BTC-PERPETUAL'
```

- SYMBOLS — a list of instruments to which the web socket subscription will be made.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, you can update the settings via the app settings menu, but adding new instruments to the subscription list must be done manually in the .env.Subscriptions file. The list should be comma-separated and may look like this: ```Bitmex_SYMBOLS="XBTUSDT, ETHUSD, XBTUSD"```. While the app is loading and unclosed positions or open orders are found for a particular instrument, that instrument will also be automatically subscribed to.

## Troubleshooting

If the program does not start or a warning or error appears, check the logfile.log file or the information widget at the top for errors.

## Trade History

Tmatic stores all your trading activity, including information on trades, financing and deliveries. After the first start of any exchange on Tmatic, a new ```env.History``` file (or ```env.History.testnet``` for the testnet environment) is created. Manage the ```env.History (env.History.testnet)``` file to set the date from which the history should be loaded. After that, the date of the last transaction is saved. You can reset the date in ```env.History (env.History.testnet)``` at any time you need. Each record in the database is unique, and no trade can be written to the database twice.

Check the ```env.History (env.History.testnet)``` file which keeps the date and time of the last transaction in the format: ```year-month-day hours:minutes:seconds``` (example ```2023-12-08 12:53:36```). You can use any date and time depending on your needs. For instance, if you want to be guaranteed to download all the transactions that were made on your current account, simply specify the year, e.g. 2000, any month, day and time. Thus, the program will download all transactions for your account starting from the very beginning. Transactions and funding will be recorded to the database in the SQLite `real_trade` (`test_trade`) table.

> [!NOTE]
> Please keep in mind that **Bitmex has removed trade history prior to 2020 for [testnet.bitmex.com](https://testnet.bitmex.com) test accounts**, so if your trading activity on [testnet.bitmex.com](https://testnet.bitmex.com) was prior to 2020, you will not be able to get your entire trade history. **Bybit only supports the last two years of trading history**. Its API allows trading history to be downloaded in 7-day chunks, so retrieving data for a long period may take time.

## How it works

Once the program is running, you can submit buy and sell orders by clicking on the order book, then cancel or move orders. However, the point of the program is the possibility of automatic trading around the clock in accordance with the established algorithms. You can use different algorithms for the same financial instrument, distributing balances and financial results separately for each algorithm or, to put it another way, for each bot. This feature is implemented in the program through the key parameter EMI, which is the bot’s identity name. When you submit an order through the program, you pass the "clOrdID" field to the exchange, which contains the bot's EMI. Thus, after the order is executed, when you receive the transaction parameters, there will also be a "clOrdID" field from which the program finds out the order number of your internal accounting and the bot’s EMI. Consequently, the program will calculate the financial result of a particular bot, its balance and make an entry into the database. Having the entire register of transactions in the database, each time after switching on, the program can correctly recalculate the balances for each bot.

EMI can be equal to the instrument symbol as the default name, for example, if you made a trade from the exchange web interface. In this case, the EMI may look, for example,  like ```"XBTUSD"```. When the program processes data from the ```execution``` stream or ```trade history``` endpoint and does not find a correspondence between the EMI from the "clOrdID" field and the field in the SQLite "robots" table, in this case the EMI may also be equal to the instrument symbol.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deribit only provides the clOrdID (the "label" in the Deribit API) for the last 5 days, so when restoring earlier trades from the trading history, there is no way to identify the bot name. Therefore, these trades will be stored in the database with the default EMI assigned with the instrument symbol.

What happens if you place an order from the standard exchange trading web interface? You will see this order in the program with EMI equal to the instrument symbol, but only if you are subscribed to a specific instrument in the ```.env.<exchange>``` file. You will be able to cancel or move this order.

## Program controls

![Image](https://github.com/evgrmn/tmatic/blob/main/scr/control.png)

1. Use the Menu to activate the auto trading mode, or go to the Bot menu, or the Settings menu, or restart the program.

2. The information widget displays all trading operations and various useful information during the program operation, including errors if they occur.

3. The Instruments menu allows you to subscribe to available instruments to receive live market data. The menu separates instruments by category and currency. It also displays the connection status, account number, and the number of times the exchange has been rebooted due to poor connection or other reasons. Once you subscribe to an instrument, it appears in section 5.

> [!NOTE]
> Options are subscribed to in series for all available call and put strikes. For each option, a subscription is made to the orderbook and ticker websocket streams. Therefore, it should be noted that subscribing to only one option series can cause a hundred or more streams at the same time, which in turn will cause a large network load. After subscribing to an option series, the option selection is made through the Option Chain.

4. You can use the order book area to place a new order. You can place an order for all available bots. Moreover, an order can be placed for a specific instrument that does not belong to any bot.

5. Click on the instrument area to switch the order book to another instrument.

6. You can choose between information blocks related to your trading activity, accounts and trading results.

![Image](https://github.com/evgrmn/tmatic/blob/main/scr/notebook.png)

- To cancel or move an order, click on the desired order in the Orders table.

7. Any information block (Orders, Positions, Trades, Account, Results, Bots) from sector 6 can be placed in sector 7 and made always visible. To do this, configure the menu Settings >> BOTTOM_FRAME.

## Bot menu

The Bot Menu simplifies the management of bots using the GUI. The functions available in the Bot Menu:

* Add a new bot.
* Update bot's state: "Disconnected", "Suspended" or "Active".
* Edit bot's parameters.
* Merge two bots.
* Duplicate bot.
* Delete bot.
* View and edit bot's strategy.
* Check the strategy syntax.
* View bot activity, including:
    * Open orders
    * Positions
    * Trades
    * Profit/Loss for each position
    * Total results, split by currency

### Add a new bot

![Image](https://github.com/evgrmn/tmatic/blob/main/scr/newbot.png)

Currently bots can only trade on timeframes, so timeframe is the only parameter that needs to be selected. Each new bot will have its own folder in the algo folder, where the strategy.py file with the bot code is placed. To manage the bot parameters, as well as to delete the bot, use the menu on the left.

Once the bot is created, a page with current parameters will open as shown below.

![Image](https://github.com/evgrmn/tmatic/blob/main/scr/bot.png)

## Add trading algorithm

### Selecting an instrument

Once you've added a new bot, you can edit strategy.py using the Tmatic interface or, more conveniently, using an IDE like PyCharm or Visual Studio code, whichever you prefer.

The functionality for the bot is in the tools.py module, so first you need to import market from that module, for example:

```python
from tools import Bybit
```

Now you can access any Bybit instrument, such as the ```BTCUSDT``` perpetual contract:

```python
instrument = Bybit["BTCUSDT"]
```

```Bybit["BTCUSDT"]``` is a class whose full list of attributes are described below:

```python
class Instrument:
    """
    Stores data for each instrument.

    """
```

So, for example, to print a list of all asks in the order book for the given instrument ```BTCUSD```, enter:

```Python
print(instrument.asks)
```

Or you can enter it in such a way that the result will be the same:

```Python
print(Bybit["BTCUSDT"].asks)
```

One bot can use multiple markets and instruments connected to Tmatic. For example, if you want ```BTCUSDT``` from Bybit and a similar instrument ```XBTUSDT``` from Bitmex, just import both markets in the strategy.py file.

```Python
from tools import Bybit, Bitmex

print(Bybit["BTCUSDT"].asks)
print(Bitmex["XBTUSDT"].asks)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To access the asks data of the Bybit ```BTCUSDT``` instrument, you must be subscribed to this instrument in the ```.env.Bybit``` file in the ```SYMBOLS``` field. The same applies to Bitmex ```XBTUSDT```. The order book data is updated via a websocket, so a subscription is required. However, to get a value such as ```qtyStep```, a subscription is not required. Such values ​​are preloaded for all available instruments after the program is launched.

### Adding kline (candlestick) data to the instrument

#### Initialization

Exchanges support thousands of instruments. Downloading kline data and then updating it for all instruments will take a lot of resources, so Tmatic will only download the data that the trader specifies in his strategy.py files.

To get kline data for an instrument, use the add_kline() method. For example, add to your strategy.py file:

```Python
from tools import Bitmex

kline = Bitmex["XBTUSDT"].add_kline()
```

Click ```Update strategy``` if you are in the Bot menu. Tmatic will make a request to the exchange and load the data into memory in the number of lines according to ```CANDLESTICK_NUMBER``` in the ```botinit/variables.py``` file. Then the data will be accumulated from the websocket, so in this case, a subscription to ```XBTUSDT``` in ```.env.Bitmex``` is required.

While ```Bitmex["XBTUSDT"].add_kline()``` is present in the ```strategy.py``` file, when Tmatic is launched or a specific exchange is restarted while Tmatic is running, the kline data will also be reloaded.

The `add_kline` method can take one argument `timefr`. Possible values: "1min", "2min", "3min", "5min", "10min", "15min", "20min", "30min", "1h", "2h", "3h", "4h", "6h", "12h", "1D". If omited, the timefr is specified in the bot parameters.

#### Get access to data

Each line of kline data is a dictionary:

```
"date": int
    date yymmdd, example 240814
"time": int
    time hhmmss, example 143200
"open_bid": float
    first bid price at the beginning of the period
"open_ask": float
    first ask price at the beginning of the period
"hi": float
    highest price of the period
"lo": float
    lowest price of the period
"funding": float
    funding rate for perpetual instruments
"datetime": datetime
    date and time in datetime format
```

The ```Bitmex["XBTUSDT"].add_kline()``` expression returns a callable object that can take one argument.

```Python
kline = Bitmex["XBTUSDT"].add_kline()
```

```Python
kline(-1)
```

A value of -1 returns data for the most recent period, -2 for the period before the most recent, and so on.

```Python
{
    "date": 240820,
    "time": 134500,
    "open_bid": 63259.5,
    "open_ask": 63260.0,
    "hi": 63260.0,
    "lo": 63259.5,
    "funding": -0.11806,
    "datetime": datetime.datetime(
        2024, 8, 20, 13, 45, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc
    ),
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> All data refers to the timeframe (timefr) specified in the bot parameters.

### Buying and Selling instructions

Available order types: `Market`, `Limit`. If a limit buy order is placed above the best ask price, the trade will be executed for this ask price. The same applies to sell orders.

Buy and sell orders are methods that can be called for any instrument from such classes as Bitmex or Bybit of the tools module. For more details, see ```Selecting an instrument``` above.

The syntax is as follows:

```Python
from tools import Bitmex, Bot
bot = Bot()

Bitmex["XBTUSDT"].sell(bot=bot)
```

or

```Python
Bitmex["XBTUSDT"].buy(bot=bot)
```

Parameters of the sell() method:

```Python
"""
Parameters
----------
bot: Bot
    An instance of a bot in the Bot class.
qty: float
    Optional. Order quantity. If qty is omitted, then: qty is taken as
    minOrderQty.
price: float
    Optional. Order price. If price is omitted for a limit order, the price
    is taken as the current first offer in the order book. For a market
    order, this parameter is ignored.
move: bool
    Optional. Checks for open sell orders for the current instrument for
    this bot and if there are any, takes the last order and moves it to the
    new price. If not, places a new order. By default False.
cancel: bool
    Optional. If True, cancels all buy orders for the current instrument for
    this bot. By default False.
ordType: str
    Optional. Order type. Valid options: Market, Limit. By default Limit.

Returns
-------
str | None
    If successful, the clOrdID of this order is returned, otherwise None.
"""
```

The parameters of the sell order are described above. All parameters except ```bot``` are optional and can be omitted.

> [!NOTE]
> The parameters of the buy order are the same, except that the price defaults to the first bid in the order book, the method moves the last buy order and cancels all sell orders accordingly.

Examples:

```Python
from tools import Bitmex, Bot
bot = Bot()
```

```Python
Bitmex["XBTUSD"].sell(bot=bot)
```
Sends a sell order, qty of XBTUSD ```minOrderQty``` is 100, price is equal to the first ask in the order book.

```Python
Bitmex["XBTUSD"].sell(bot=bot, qty=200)
```
Sends a sell order, qty is 200, price is equal to the first ask in the order book.

```Python
Bitmex["XBTUSD"].buy(bot=bot, qty=200, move=True)
```

Sends a buy order, qty is 200, price is equal to the first bid in the order book. Checks for open buy orders on ```XBTUSD``` for this bot and if there are any, takes the last order and moves it to the new price. If not, places a new order.

```Python
Bitmex["XBTUSD"].buy(bot=bot, qty=200, price=50000, move=True)
```

Sends a buy order, qty is 200, price is 50000. Checks for open buy orders on ```XBTUSD``` for this bot and if there are any, takes the last order and moves it to the new price. If not, places a new order.

```Python
Bitmex["XBTUSD"].buy(bot=bot, qty=200, price=50000, move=True, cancel=True)
```

Sends a buy order, qty is 200, price is 50000. Checks for open buy orders on ```XBTUSD``` for this bot and if there are any, takes the last order and moves it to the new price. If not, places a new order. Cancels all sell orders for the ```XBTUSD``` for this bot.

### Limits control

When an order is submitted, Tmatic does not allow the bot to exceed the set limit for the instrument. It decreases quantity if the limit is exceeded. If the limit is completely exhausted, the order will not be sent to the exchange. If the bot does not have a position for this instrument, then such a position will be added to the bot, and the limit is set as default equal to ```minOrderQty``` of the instrument.

Examples:

Let's say the bot is trading ```BTCUSDT``` on Bybit. ```minOrderQty``` for ```BTCUSDT``` is 0.001. The table below shows possible scenarios:

|Current position|Limit|Side|Qty|Result|
| ------------- |:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----------------------------------:|
|None|None|Buy|0.001|The limit is set to 0.001. Buy order sent, qty = **0.001**|
|None|None|Buy|0.002|The limit is set to 0.001. Buy order sent, qty = **0.001**|
|0.001|0.001|Buy|0.001|Nothing happens. Buy order ignored|
|-0.001|0.001|Buy|0.002|Buy order sent, qty = **0.002**|
|-0.001|0.002|Buy|0.005|Buy order sent, qty = **0.003**|
|0.002|0.002|Sell|0.005|Sell order sent, qty = **0.004**|
|-0.001|0.002|Sell|0.005|Sell order sent, qty = **0.001**|

### Setting limits

Use ```set_limit()``` method to specify the position limits that the bot is allowed to trade on the instrument.

```Python
"""
Parameters
----------
bot: Bot
    An instance of a bot in the Bot class.
limit: float
    The limit of positions the bot is allowed to trade on this instrument.
    If this parameter is less than the instrument's minOrderQty, it
    becomes minOrderQty.
"""
```

Example:

```Python
from tools import Bitmex, Bot
bot = Bot()

Bitmex["XBTUSDT"].set_limit(bot=bot, limit=0.003)
```

### Get limit

Use ```limit()``` method to get bot limit on the instrument.

```Python
"""
Parameters
----------
bot: Bot
    An instance of a bot in the Bot class.

Returns
-------
float
    Bot position limit for the instrument.
"""
```

Example:

```Python
from tools import Bitmex, Bot
bot = Bot()

print(Bitmex["XBTUSDT"].limit(bot=bot))
```

Result:

```Python
0.001

bot = Bot()

print(Bitmex["XBTUSDT"].position(bot=bot))
```

Result:

```Python
0.001
```

### Get bot's orders for the instrument

Use the ```orders()``` method to get the current open orders for a given instrument. If necessary, filter the orders by sell or buy side and sort them in descending order. Set the `in_list` parameter to return the result in a list or OrderedDict format.

```Python
"""
Parameters

### Remove order

Use the ```remove()``` method to delete an open order by its clOrdID.

```Python
"""
Removes the open order by its clOrdID or symbol.

Parameters:
-----------`
Removes the open order by its clOrdID or symbol.

Parameters:
-----------
clOrdID: str
    Order ID. Example: "1348642035.Super"
    If this parameter is omitted, orders for this bot will be
    deleted by the symbol parameter.
symbol: str
    Example: "ETH-PERPETUAL". If this parameter is omitted,
    all orders for this bot will be deleted.
"""
```

Example: This example shows how to place a sell order at the first ask price and remove it in 5 seconds.

```Python
import time
from tools import Bitmex, Bot

bot = Bot()

id = Bitmex["XBTUSDT"].sell(bot=bot)
time.sleep(5)
bot.remove(clOrdID=id)
```

> [!NOTE]
> If the deletion failed in case the clOrdID is not found, a message will appear in the bot log. You can see it in the Bot menu, on the Log tab, in the Notepad widget.

### Replace order

Use the ```replace()``` method to move an open order to a new price using its clOrdID.

```Python
"""
Parameters
----------
bot: Bot
    An instance of a bot in the Bot class.
clOrdID: str
    Order ID. Order ID. Example: "1348642035.Super"
price: float
    New price to reset order to.

Returns
-------
str | None
    On success, clOrdID is returned, otherwise an error type.
"""
```

Example: This example shows how to place a sell order at the first ask price and move it to the first ask price + 100 in 5 seconds.

```Python
import time
from tools import Bitmex, Bot

bot = Bot()
instrument = Bitmex["XBTUSDT"]

id = instrument.sell(bot=bot)
time.sleep(5)
price = instrument.asks[0][0] + 100
bot.replace(clOrdID=id, price=price)
```

> [!NOTE]
> If the replacement failed in case the clOrdID is not found, a message will appear in the bot log. You can see it in the Bot menu, on the Log tab, in the Notepad widget.

### Special functions

The bot strategy is located in the strategy.py file in the ```/algo/<bot name>``` folder. Some strategy functions have reserved names and the following uses:

```setup_bot()``` - works when Tmatic is started, restarted or the bot is updated. Use this function if the bot requires preliminary settings after starting the application or updating the strategy in the bot menu.

```activate_bot()``` - sometimes you need to make changes to the bot parameters when switching the bot state to Active. Every time you make the bot active from the bot menu, this function is triggered.

```update_bot()``` - at the moment, bots work on timeframes from 1 minute to 1 day. Each time at the beginning of a new period, this function is called.

```run_bot()``` - similar to update_bot and is also called at the beginning of a new period after update_bot. In addition, it is called every time after any of the bot orders is fully executed. Additional calls must be activated via the ```multitrade``` bot parameter. Example:

```Python
from tools import Bot

bot = Bot()
bot.multitrade = True
```

All special functions are optional and may be missing from the strategy file. Use them at your discretion, but for the bot to start trading, one of the update_bot or run_bot functions is required. It is convenient to put sell and buy instructions in these functions. You can also use both of these functions at the same time, for example, update_bot to update the bot parameters and run_bot to manage sells and buys.


### Strategy example

The minimum possible code to run a strategy might look like this. Let's say the strategy buys when the current price is higher than the price 10 periods ago, and sells when the current price is lower than or equal to the price 10 periods ago. When buying, the strategy places a limit order to buy at the first bid price in the order book, and does the same when selling by placing a limit order at the first ask price. Instrument BTCUSDT, exchange Bybit, limit is the minimum possible quantity for the given instrument.

This code is just a simple example and does not claim to be profitable.

```Python
from tools import Bybit, Bot

bot = Bot()
instrument = Bybit["BTCUSDT"]
kline = instrument.add_kline()

def run_bot():
    if kline("bid", -1) > kline("open_bid", -10):
        instrument.buy(bot=bot, move=True, cancel=True)
    else:
        instrument.sell(bot=bot, move=True, cancel=True)
```
